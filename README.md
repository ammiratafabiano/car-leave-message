This is a straightforward web application developed to facilitate secure communication between passersby and car owners. The app features a QR code displayed on the car's windshield, enabling individuals who notice issues with the vehicle or need to contact the owner for any reason to send a message securely, without exposing the owner's phone number.

## Key Features

- **QR Code Integration:** A unique QR code is prominently displayed on the car's windshield, leading users to the app's website for communication.

## How It Works

- **QR Code Placement:** Affix the provided QR code sticker on your car's windshield, visible to passersby.
- **Message Sending:** Anyone scanning the QR code is redirected to the app's website, where they can send a message to the car owner regarding any issues or concerns.

## Language
- **Italian**
- **English**

Make sure you have [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) and [Ionic](https://ionicframework.com/docs/intro/cli) installed on your system before running these commands. After following these steps, the app will be up and running locally on your machine.
